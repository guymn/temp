// 2. Implement a 'chargeBattery' method which takes an argument 'chargeTo' and sets the battery charge to 'chargeTo'

// 3. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 20, and decrease the charge by 1%. Then log a message like this: 'Tesla going at 140 km/h, with a charge of 22%'

// 4. Create an electric car object and experiment with calling 'accelerate', 'brake' and 'chargeBattery' (charge to 90%). Notice what happens when you 'accelerate'! Hint: Review the definiton of polymorphism ðŸ˜‰

// ### Test data:

// - Data car 1: 'Tesla' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%
const tesla = new EV('Tesla', 120, 23);
const car1 = new EV('Tesla', 120, 23);
car1.accelerate();
car1.brake();
car1.chargeBattery(90);
